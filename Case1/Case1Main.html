<h1>Case Study Number 1</h1>

<div class="caseinfo">
<h4><u>Case Study Number 1</u></h4>
<p>
You are the investigator Mr. CIC. You are the lead investigator in another one of Mr. Evil Noodle’s cases. In case you have forgotten, Mr. Evil Noodle is a pseudonym for a cybercriminal who has committed nefarious deeds in the past, such as running his own darknet site where drugs were sold. In this case, one of Mr. Evil Noodle’s henchmen, Ronald Noodleboy, is under suspicion for stealing a monkey from the local Curry’s zoo. Unfortunately, the monkey that Ronald Noodleboy stole was the special Monkey King. In order to steal the Monkey King one must have both the passwords to shut down the security cameras and open up the cage. Curry explains that Mr. Evil Noddle must have stolen his data when Curry was sending the passwords to a coworker over public wifi without using a VPN.

<h3><u>Your Options</u><h3>
 <ul>
   <li><em><a href="Option1/option1A.html">No - Digital evidence is not allowed to affect court decisions.</a></em></li>

   <li><em><a href="Option1/option1BCor.html">Yes - Digital evidence is a powerful and influential tool in cases such as this. However, one must be careful in the case that evidence found is faulty. It is then up to investigators to make sure that evidence found is not dubious or false so that the jury does not get a false impression.</a></em></li>

   <li><em><a href="Option1/option1C.html">No - The average juror is too technologically inept and so will not be able to distinguish between dubious or actual evidence. Therefore it is better not to use it.</a></em></li>

   <li><em><a href="Option1/option1D.html">Yes - The average juror  will be able to determine whether the evidence is dubious or not when presented to them.</a></em></li>

<h4><u>Question 1</u></h4>
<p>
However, there is one problem: no one can find the monkey. The only reason why investigators believe it to be Mr. Ronald Noodleboy is because they traced the hacker to a computer in the vicinity of his house. Unfortunately, without a monkey to prove that it was Mr. Ronald Noodleboy, his lawyers assert that it was not him. It is up to you to find evidence to figure whether or not it was truly Mr. Ronald Noodleboy who committed the crime.<br>

One day, while you and authorities are searching through Ronald’s apartment, you come across Ronald’s computer. This is your first question. Investigators decide to do some forensic analysis and see if the device has any useful pieces of information. Should you or should you not take into account any digital evidence found?
