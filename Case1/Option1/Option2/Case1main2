<p>
Alright you and the authorities have access to Ronald’s computer. They run a program that scans Ronald’s past searches in Internet Explorer. There could be a chance that he looked up topics related to monkeys during his preparation for the crime. This is it - the moment of truth. They scan it ...  and no words related to monkey stealing come up. What should you do?

   <li><em><a href="Option2Ans/option2A.html">Give up - the evidence speaks for itself and there is nothing you can do.</a></em></li>

   <li><em><a href="Option2Ans/option2B.html">Present to the court that because there are no searches, Ronald must have deleted his search history and be guilty.</a></em></li>

   <li><em><a href="Option2Ans/option2corC.html">Run a program that looks into the search history of other browsers on Ronald’s computer.</a></em></li>
