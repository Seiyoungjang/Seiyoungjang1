<h1>Question 2</h1>


<div class="explanation">
<h4><u>Incorrect!</u></h4>
<p>
Incorrect! Remember in the case of Casey Anthony a lack of thorough explanation and investigation heavily crippled the prosecution’s case. Because the prosecution never properly explained the mismatch of timestamps to searches, the defense was able to poke a hole in the prosecution’s case and convince the jury. A similar issue is apparent here. There is a flaw in the evidence that if you do not take it into account, the jury can be easily persuaded by the other side.
