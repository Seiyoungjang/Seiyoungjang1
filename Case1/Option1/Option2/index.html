<h2><u>Question 2</u></h2>
<p>
Alright you and the authorities have access to Ronald’s computer. They run a program that scans Ronald’s past searches in Internet Explorer. There could be a chance that he looked up topics related to monkeys during his preparation for the crime. This is it - the moment of truth. They scan it ...  and no words related to monkey stealing come up. What should you do?
