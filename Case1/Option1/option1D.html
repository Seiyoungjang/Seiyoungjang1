<h1>Question 1</h1>


<div class="explanation">
<h4><u>Incorrect!</u></h4>
<p>
Unfortunately this is incorrect. Although it is wrong to assume things, if you were to, you should put more stock into the fact that the jury wonâ€™t be great at technology. Think about it like this. If you were to explain how data structures work to a middle aged man, would you think there is a high chance of him knowing all the lingo that goes with computer coding? I would say probably not. The jury is the same when it comes to cybercrimes. Extra steps should be taken to make sure that the jury fully understands the digital evidence presented to them so that they are not swayed by misleading or false evidence.
