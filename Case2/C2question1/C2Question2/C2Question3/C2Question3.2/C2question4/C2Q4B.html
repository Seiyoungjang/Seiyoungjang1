<h1>Question 4</h1>


<div class="explanation">
<h2><u>Incorrect!</u></h2>
<p>
Incorrect! The evidence does not necessarily have to be “easily understandable” as such a thing is arbitrary and hard to measure. What is easily understandable to one person may be difficult to comprehend to another. In addition, evidence does need to be physical in order to be valid. If that was the case, then there would be no reason teaching this in a Cybersecurity exercise.
