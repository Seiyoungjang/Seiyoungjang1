<h1>Question 4</h1>


<div class="explanation">
<h2><u>Incorrect!</u></h2>
<p>
Incorrect! For one, it is hard to qualify something as “new”. Everyone can have a different perception of what things are old or new, and so it would be very messy if this was a requirement in a test of admissibility. Thankfully, it is not. In addition, evidence can be physical in order for it to pass the test. This makes sense since the test was created before digital evidence entered the equation. That would be some galaxy brain move if they thought about something that did not exist.
