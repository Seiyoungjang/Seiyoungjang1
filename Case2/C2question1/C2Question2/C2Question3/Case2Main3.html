<h1>Question 3</h1>

<div class="cont">
<h4><u>Context</u></h4>
<p>
Alright, you have procured the warrant you need. The warrant is for the search and seizure of Ms. Ducksauce’s laptop. While searching you also find Ms. Ducksauce’s phone lying about. As you know there is a lot of debate as to how to handle warrants. However, when you bring this up to the other officers, officer Joe Spongecake states that because it has been legally established that digital evidence falls under the “plain view” doctrine, he can just search the phone. Is this true?

<div class="Choice">
<h3><u>Your Options</u><h3>
 <ul>
   <li><em><a href="C2Q3A.html">Yes - there is little to no debate that items such as cell phones can be searched without a warrant if found under the “plain view” doctrine.</a></em></li>

   <li><em><a href="C2Q3B.html">No - There is much debate amongst scholars of how to use digital evidence related to the “plain view” doctrine.</a></em></li>
