<h1>Case Study Number 2</h1>

<div class="cont">
<h4><u>Context</u></h4>
<p>
Another breaking case involving Mr. Evil Noodle has occurred. In the town of Cheeseville, where you live, people have been reporting an increase in cybercriminal activity such as ransomware and scareware. A woman named Ms. Ducksauce, who recently moved in around the time the increase in cybercriminal activity started, was reported to be potentially performing cybercriminal activity in a local coffee shop by an officer. Because no one knows for sure, you as an investigator wish to find any evidence to see if Ms. Ducksauce truly was and has been performing cybercriminal activity. If this was a traditional case you would normally need a warrant due to the U.S Constitution, but since you wish to search Ms. Ducksauce’s computers, which is digital evidence, do you need a warrant?

   <li><em><a href="C2question1/C2Q1C.html">Yes - because the electronic storage device was not linked to a physical crime and therefore needs a warrant according to the Third Amendment.</a></em></li>
