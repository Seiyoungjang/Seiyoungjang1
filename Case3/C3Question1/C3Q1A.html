<h1>Question 1</h1>


<div class="explanation">
<h2><u>Correct!</u></h2>
<p>
Correct! Sufficiency of Evidence was found to be the most frequently occuring legal issue encountered as a basis for appeal at 31.03%. Mr. Pickle’s lawyers are arguing that the fact that all the kids who were found with Magic Milk had contacted Mr. Pickle online is not enough to prove that Mr. Pickle was the one who gave them the Magic Milk. However, the case is ongoing and the result is not looking so good for Mr. Pickle.
