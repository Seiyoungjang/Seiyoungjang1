<h1>Question 2</h1>


<div class="explanation">
<h2><u>Correct!</u></h2>
<p>
Correct! Remember in United States V. Hampton, Jack Eugene Hampton found himself in a similar situation to what Ms. Calamari finds herself in. Hampton tried to make a similar argument of a defective warrant and stale information for his case involving the distribution of child pornography. However, this was shot down by the Sixth Circuit Court as child pornography “is generally carried out in the secrecy of the home and over a long period.” This would make it so that the information was not stale and, therefore, making the warrant valid.
