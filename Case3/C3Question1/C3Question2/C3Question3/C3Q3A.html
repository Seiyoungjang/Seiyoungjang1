<h1>Question 3</h1>


<div class="explanation">
<h2><u>Incorrect!</u></h2>
<p>
Incorrect! The nature of distributing these illegal videos (whether that be sending around illegal pornography or videos monkies dancing) is that they are typically carried out over a long period. Basically, it is not a singular instance. Therefore, this information does not get stale in the context of a warrant, allowing for a warrant issued 5 months ago to still be applicable. Also there is no such “5 month” limit for warrants.
