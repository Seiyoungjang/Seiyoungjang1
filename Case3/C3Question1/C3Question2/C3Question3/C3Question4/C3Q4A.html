<h1>Question 4</h1>


<div class="explanation">
<h2><u>Correct!</u></h2>
<p>
Correct! Charles Katz was a resident of Los Angeles, California and had a long history of being involved in sports betting. In February 1965, Katz on multiple occasions used a public telephone booth near his apartment to provide his gambling handicaps to bookmakers (people who accept and pay off bets on sporting and other events at agreed-upon odds) in Boston and Miami. However, unbeknownst to him, the FBI had begun investigating his gambling activities and were recording his conversations with a covert listening device attached to the outside of the phone booth. After recording his phone calls, FBI agents arrested Katz and charged him with eight counts of knowingly transmitting wagering information over telephone between states, which is a federal crime.

<br>
<br>

Katz was soon tried in court. Katz's lawyer put forth the idea that because the FBI agents did not have a search warrant allowing them to place their listening device, the recordings had been made in violation of the Fourth Amendment and should therefore be inadmissible in the court of law. The judge gave the classic “no” and then Katz was convicted based on them.

Katz appealed his case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit shortly after. However, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed Katz's conviction, ruling that because the FBI's eavesdropping device was not physically placed inside the telephone booth's wall, no Fourth Amendment search occurred, and so the FBI did not need a search warrant to place the device. Katz then appealed to the Supreme Court, where it was decided in 7–1 vote in favor of Katz that invalidated the FBI's wiretap and overturned Katz's conviction. This is how the idea of a reasonable <q>expectation of privacy</q> came about.
