<h1>Question 4</h1>


<div class="explanation">
<h2><u>Incorrect!</u></h2>
<p>
Incorrect! Both of these don't make much sense. For one, defendants don’t need to know that an officer received a warrant before the actual search begins. In addition, the defendant doesn’t get to make up his/her personal expectations of privacy. If that was the case, a drug smuggler could say that they expect 100% privacy in their home and therefore the police will never get his stash of magic mushrooms.
