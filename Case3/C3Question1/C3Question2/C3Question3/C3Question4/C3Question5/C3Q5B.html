<h1>Question 5</h1>


<div class="explanation">
<h2><u>Incorrect!</u></h2>
<p>
Incorrect! The evidence lacks probative value. 
By bringing up an unrelated conversation, it not only has no effect on the truth of the case, but it also could unfairly bias judges against Mr. Tofu. 
The idea that one conversation is a perfect demonstration of oneâ€™s behavior is not correct nor should be used in court.
