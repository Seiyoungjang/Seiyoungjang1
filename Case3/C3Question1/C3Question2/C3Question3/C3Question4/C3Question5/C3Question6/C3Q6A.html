<h1>Question 6</h1>


<div class="explanation">
<h2><u>Correct!</u></h2>
<p>
Correct! One of the main reasons why the idea of hearsay exists is to prevent gossip from being the thing that convicts someone. 
Unlike in United States v. Lizarraga-Tirado where the court ruled that a photograph is not hearsay, 
this kind of gossip is hearsay because it makes an assertion that potentially does not reflect the truth.
