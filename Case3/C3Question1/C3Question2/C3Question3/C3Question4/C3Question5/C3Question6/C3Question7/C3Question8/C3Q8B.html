<h1>Question 8</h1>


<div class="explanation">
<h2><u>Correct!</u></h2>
<p>
Correct! Duplicated copies of evidence are as viable as the original as long as there is no genuine concern that some alteration was made to the duplicate and of the authenticity of the original copy. So in this case, because there was little doubt that the original chat content was altered in any way, a perfect duplicate would be perfectly acceptable.
