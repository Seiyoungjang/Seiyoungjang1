<h1>Question 8</h1>

<div class="cont">
<h4><u>Question</u></h4>
<p>
Finally in the case of Mr. Pesto. Mr. Pesto was charged with saying rude things to kids on a local Minecraft server. 
In the trial, investigators took the contents of the chat in which Mr. Pesto said those terrible words and 
copied them onto a document which was printed out. 
The contents of the chat revealed that Mr. Presto called kids “big muppets” and “fat ducks,” 
words that are against the law to say together(not in actual life by the way). 
However, he claimed that the duplicated evidence used against him was not admissible in court due to the fact that it was not the original. 
Is Mr. Pesto correct?
