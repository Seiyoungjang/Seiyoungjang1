<h4><u>Conclusion</u></h4>
<p>

As you answer his questions you hear Me. Evil Noodles scream on the phone. What is odd is that you hear the scream within the building, which must mean that Mr. Evil Noodle is somewhere in the building in which you are in. As you run towards the sound, you find that it is coming from behind a door. After opening the door, you see Mr. Evil Noodle being attacked by Mr. Curry’s hamster. After you and the hamster defeat Mr. Evil Noodle, he is cuffed and arrested. You find it odd how Mr. Evil Noodle was caught so easily. However, you realize that what is important is that no one will be hurt by Mr. Evil Noodle’s actions again…
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Mr. Curry’s hamster got all the credit for the arrest of Mr. Noodle. The hamster was made an investigator and given praise for all for her heroic duties.
