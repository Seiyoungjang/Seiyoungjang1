<h1>Question 8</h1>

<div class="cont">
<h4><u>Question</u></h4>
<p>

As you answer his questions you hear Me. Evil Noodles scream on the phone. What is odd is that you hear the scream within in the building, which must mean that Mr. Evil Noodle is somewhere in the building in which you are in. As you run towards the sound, you find that it is coming from behind a door. After opening the door, you see Mr. Evil Noodle being attacked by Mr. Curry’s hamster. After you and the hamster defeat Mr. Evil Noodle, he is cuffed and arrested.
