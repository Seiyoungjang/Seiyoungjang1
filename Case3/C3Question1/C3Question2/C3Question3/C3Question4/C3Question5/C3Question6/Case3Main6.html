<h1>Question 6</h1>

<div class="cont">
<h4><u>Question</u></h4>
<p>
For his next challenge Mr. Evil Noodle gives you the case of Ms. Asparagus. 
Ms. Asparagus was charged for scamming money online from others. During the trial, a witness was called up and stated that her friend Sally McWopper 
texted her once that Ms. Asparagus was a very rude woman and liked stealing. 
Unfortunately, Sally McWopper was traveling during the case so she could not be called for testimony.
However, Ms. Asparagus claimed innocence and appealed on the basis that the evidence of the conversation would fall under hearsay 
and, therefore, should not have been presented in court. Is this true?
(You can click the question mark below if you would like more details about hearsay)

<div class="Choice">
<h3><u>Your Options</u><h3>
 <ul>
   <li><em><a href="C3Q6A.html">Yes - the testimony relies on an out-of-court statement to try prove a point.</a></em></li>
<br>
   <li><em><a href="C3Q6B.html">No - while this would be considered hearsay, hearsay is often still allowed to be used in court</a></em></li>
<br>
   <li><em><a href="C3Q6C.html">Yes - testimony about another person’s word on text falls under hearsay because it is making an assertion about another on a digital medium.</a></em></li>
<br>
   <li><em><a href="C3Q6D.html">No - testimony about another person’s word does not fall hearsay.</a></em></li>
