<h1>Question 6</h1>

<div class="cont">
<h4><u>Question</u></h4>
<p>
For his next challenge Mr. Evil Noodle gives you the case of Ms. Asparagus. Ms. Asparagus was charged for scamming money online from others. A piece of evidence that was presented to the court was a conversation between two people talking over text about how they heard about Ms. Asparagus scamming others. However, Ms. Asparagus claimed innocence and appealed on the basis that the evidence of the conversation would fall under hearsay and therefore should not have been presented in court. Is this true? (You can click the question mark below if you would like more details about hearsay)
