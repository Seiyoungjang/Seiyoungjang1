<h4><u>Question 5</u></h4>
<p>
However you think that something is odd. Why is Mr. Curry asking you all these questions? In addition, none of this information has been leaked on the news. So how does he know about it? Before you can ask you hear another voice on the phone.

<h5><u>Mr. Evil Noodle</u></h5>
“Hello, my name is Mr. Evil Noodle. It's good to finally meet you feeble human. 
If you are curious what has happened to your chum Mr. Curry, well, he’s in my belly! 
I’m joking of course; I did not eat him. Mr. Curry is right here and has been reading to you a script I wrote for him. 
It was very easy to make him do my bidding when I took his pet hamster hostage. 
Now, I am very bored, and I want to keep quizzing you. After all, most of my operations have stopped because you arrested all my minions. 
If you succeed in answering all of these questions, I will let Mr. Curry and his hamster go free. 
<br>
<br>
Now for my first test I give you the case of Mr. Tofu. 
Mr. Tofu was arrested for spamming emails containing memes to governmental figures. 
In the case, messages of Mr. Tofu arguing with his friend Timmy over what bread tastes the best were used in the trial to convict Mr. Tofu. 
However, Mr. Tofu appealed that the conversation had no probative value, and, therefore, should not have been admitted. Is this true and why?"

<div class="Choice">
<h3><u>Your Options</u><h3>
 <ul>
   <li><em><a href="C3Q5A.html">Yes, the evidence has no probative value because it is a conversation between two individuals.</a></em></li>
<br>
   <li><em><a href="C3Q5B.html">No, the evidence contains probative value as it shows that Mr. Tofu is the type of person who would troll the government by giving a reference for past behavior.</a></em></li>
<br>
   <li><em><a href="C3Q5C.html">Yes, the evidence has no probative value because it provides no relevant evidence to the crime in question.</a></em></li>
