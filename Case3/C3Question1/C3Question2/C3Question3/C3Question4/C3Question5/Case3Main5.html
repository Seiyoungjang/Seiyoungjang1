<h4><u>Question 5</u></h4>

However you think that something is odd. Why is Mr. Curry asking you all these questions? In addition, none of this information has been leaked on the news. So how does he know about it? Before you can ask you hear another voice on the phone.

<h5><u>Mr. Evil Noodle</u></h5>
“Hello, my name is Mr. Evil Noodle. It's good to finally meet you feeble human. If you are curious what has happened to your chum Mr. Curry, well, he’s in my belly! I’m joking of course; I did not eat him. Mr. Curry is right here and has been reading to you a script I wrote for him. It was very easy to make him do my bidding when I took his pet hamster hostage. Now, I am very bored, and I want to keep quizzing you. After all, most of my operations have stopped because you arrested all my minions. If you succeed in answering all of these questions, I will let Mr. Curry and his hamster go free.

Now for my first test I give you the case of Mr. Tofu. Mr. Tofu was arrested for “trolling” children on a local Minecraft server. The investigators stated that the cell-site tracking analysis did not show that Mr. Tofu was absent from the home during the hours a person on the server, assumed to be Mr. Tofu, was trolling. However Mr. Tofu made the appeal that such information is not relevant and cannot be used to decide whether it was him or someone else in this family who was bullying kids on Minecraft servers. What did the court decide?

<h3><u>Your Options</u><h3>
 <ul>
   <li><em><a href="C3Q5A.html">Because the limit for the amount of time a warrant can be active is 5 months, Ms. Calamari would have a legitimate appeal as the warrant is now stale.</a></em></li>

   <li><em><a href="C3Q5B.html">Due to the nature of distributing videos, the crime is classified as one that is carried over a long period of time. Therefore, the information that the warrant was to seek never went stale. This would mean that Ms. Calamari’s sentence and conviction would be affirmed.</a></em></li>
