<u>Mr. Curry:</u>
<br>
<br>
Why thank you for answering my question. You know what chap? I heard about another story on the news recently. This time involved a fellow who went by the name Mr. Sushi. Weird name right? Anyways, apparently this Sushi fellow appealed his conviction on the basis that the search conducted on him was an unreasonable search due to <q>expectation of privacy</q>. He referenced some cases called Katz v. United States. Would you happen to know what standard(s) regarding an expectation of privacy were derived from Katz v. United States?

Well the answer to your question would be...
</p>

 <ul>
   <li><em><a href="C3Q4A.html">A search can be deemed unreasonable if the defendant exhibited an actual expectation of privacy and if the expectation was one that society would deem as “reasonable”.</a></em></li>
<br>
   <li><em><a href="C3Q4B.html">A search can be deemed unreasonable if the defendant did not know about the warrant obtained and if the officers did not ask the defendant's expectation of privacy before conducting the search.</a></em></li>
<br>

   <li><em><a href="C3Q4C.html">A search can be deemed unreasonable if it occurred on private property without the owner’s consent even with a warrant. 
</a></em></li>
<br>



 </ul>
