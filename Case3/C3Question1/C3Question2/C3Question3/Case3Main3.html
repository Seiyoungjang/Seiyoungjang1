<br>
Well hello Mr. Curry. It has been quite good. Besides all the criminals I've had to deal with, it has been a pretty normal week.

<u>Mr. Curry:</u>
<br>
<br>
You know, I heard that Ms. CabbageJuice, a close affiliate of Mr. Evil Noodle has filed an appeal on the basis of the scope of the warrant used to catch her stealing Minecraft accounts from children online. However, I am a bit confused about some of the legal details behind the case. What basis are scope-of-warrant appeals made?

<br>
Well the answer to your question would be...
</p>

 <ul>
   <li><em><a href="C3Q3A.html">Scope of Warrant appeals are based on whether the warrant was broad enough to take the item in question and whether the information taken was digital or physical.</a></em></li>
<br>
   <li><em><a href="C3Q3B.html">Scope of Warrant appeals are based on whether the warrant was specific enough to take the item in question and whether the information taken was digital or physical.</a></em></li>
<br>

   <li><em><a href="C3Q3C.html">Scope of Warrant appeals are based on whether the warrant supplied adequate information to guide officers in selecting what to take, and whether the category of item specific in the warrant was too vague.</a></em></li>
<br>



 </ul>
