<h1>Question 2</h1>

<div class="cont">
<h4><u>Question</u></h4>
<p>
The next case you look at is the one of Ms. Calamari, who was arrested after officials used a warrant to search through her computer and found that she was illegally distributing videos of chipmunks dancing. However, authorities obtained a warrant for her 1 years ago. The reason why they could not carry it out was due to the fact that Ms.Calamari seemingly disappeared. 
<br>
<br>
Now 1 years later, Ms. Calamari’s lawyer is saying that the 10 year delay on carrying out the warrant has made it stale and defective. Therefore, the lawyer is arguing that because the warrant was defective, authorities had no business searching Ms. Calamari’s computer. Based on past cases, what would be the predicted outcome of this appeal?

<div class="Choice">
<h3><u>Your Options</u><h3>
 <ul>
   <li><em><a href="C3Q2A.html">Because the limit for the amount of time a warrant can be active is 5 months, Ms. Calamari would have a legitimate appeal as the warrant is now stale.</a></em></li>

   <li><em><a href="C3Q2B.html">Due to the nature of distributing videos, the crime is classified as one that is carried over a long period of time. Therefore, the information that the warrant was to seek never went stale. This would mean that Ms. Calamari’s sentence and conviction would be affirmed.</a></em></li>
