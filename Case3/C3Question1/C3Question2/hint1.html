Congratulations for finding this! Give yourself another hint coin. Now, the past case you should be referencing is United States V. Hampton. If you remember from your readings, the case saw Jack Hampton claim that the warrant used by the police to search his residence for child pornagraphy was <q>stale because the warrant was executed more than ten months after German law enforcement officers observed child pornography shared through his IP address.</q> Recall what the outcome of that case was and apply it here.
