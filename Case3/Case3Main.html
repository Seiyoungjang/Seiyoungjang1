<h1>Case Study Number 3</h1>

<div class="cont">
<h4><u>Question</u></h4>
<p>
You have been searching for and have been arresting many of Mr. Evil Noodleâ€™s henchmen for the past few months. 
However, knowing that his numbers were thinning out, Mr. Evil Noodle has decided to hire lawyers to appeal the cases for many of his henchmen. 
You are now looking over all the cases.<br>
<br>
The first case that has come to your attention is that of Mr. Pickle. Mr. Pickle was caught by you and your team selling magic milk (a new type of drug) 
online to teenagers. However, his case is being appealed for reconsideration by a lawyer that you assume to be from Mr. Evil Noodle. 
The reason for appeal was written down, however, your clumsy assistant Mr. Teriyaki spilled his coffee on that section. 
He tells you that he remembers realizing that it was the most common basis for appeal. Based on that, what was the basis for appeal?
