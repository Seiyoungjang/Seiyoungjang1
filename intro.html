<h1> Cybersecurity Case Study </h1>

<div class="description1"> 
<h3> <u>Information</u> </h3>
<p>
<b>
Hello welcome! This website is designed to be a fun and interactive way of reviewing cybersecurity concepts that you have learnt about. So how does this work? Each case will act as a quiz. No wait, don’t run away! They are not graded so you don’t have to worry about it. Anyways, you will be playing the role of Mr. CIC, a cybersecurity investigator, attempting to take down Mr. Evil Noodle and his henchmen. 
<br>
<br>
Each of the cases will have a story connected with each other so it is recommended that you start with one and finish with three. Each question will multiple choice and will explain to you if you get a question wrong why the answer was incorrect. In order to progress in the story you must get a question correct. There will sometimes be extensions (vidoes, articles, ect.) that will either help teach or expand upon concepts. This is meant to be a fun activity - there is no hidden bot tracking your progress.

<h3> <u>Hint Coins!</u> </h3>
<p>
<b>
Throughout your journey you may want to click on places that you would not expect to have links to other pages. Why may you ask? Well, within each case study there will be things called “Hint Coin Pages”. What is a “Hint Coin Page”? Well, what an excellent question! Thank you for asking. A “Hint Coin Page” is a secret page that can be accessed by links hidden throughout this whole website (for example: you may accidently click on a picture that takes you to a “Hint Coin Page”).
<br>
<br>
These pages typically will give you help on solving a problem and/or give you extension sources to further your understanding. Make sure to keep track of how many you come across as at the end it will be revealed how many of them there in total. If you end up discovering all the Hint Coins, congratulations! If not, that is also fine. This is just meant to spice up your experience.
